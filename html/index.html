        <p>The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. I know words. I have the best words. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?</p>

        <p>I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p> 
            
        <p>My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.</p>
            
        <p>Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p>
            
        <p>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I know words. I have the best words. I know words. I have the best words. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.</p>
